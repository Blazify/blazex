# BlazeScript

## Installation

[Github Releases](https://github.com/BlazifyOrg/blazescript/releases)

## Note

This language is very much work in-progress. We are also working on a [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/BlazifyOrg/blazescript-vscode) and we are also looking for collaborators

## Announcment

The Bytecode Compiler and the VM are in progress, to use all features of the language use the code from the [70th Commit](https://github.com/BlazifyOrg/blazescript/tree/a2e2186bec75bc05a86ebd3192fa9d931475cb80)

## Example

- Printing the famous "Hello World"

```bzs
println("Hello World!") @ yep as simple as that
```

- Comments

```bzs
@ single line comment
@@
	multi-line comment
@@
```

- Creating and calling functions

```bzs
fun sum(a, b) => {
    var c = a + b;
    return c;
}

println(sum(2, 2));
```

- Working around with objects

```bzs
var obj = {
    "prop": 5 @ properties should be of String type or there will be Invalid Syntax Error
}

println(obj.prop); @ accessing object property

obj.prop = 10; @ editing object property value
println(obj.prop) @ 10
```

- Classes

```bzs
class Main {
    var a = 10; @ this is a property

    @ this is constructor
    fun() {
        soul.a = 5; @ soul is the current object it's operating on
    }

    @ this is a method
    fun sum_to_a(b) => {
        soul.a = soul.a + b;
        return soul;
    }
}

var ins = new Main(); @ creating/initializing a class, returns a object with the properties
println(ins);

println(ins.sum_to_a(5));
```

## Contributing
